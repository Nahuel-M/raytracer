Basic raytracer written completely in Rust.

To do:
- [x] Make camera rotate with quaternion around stable axis (without roll)
- [x] Increase efficiency of polygon hit calculation
- [ ] Normals for vertices, interpolate normal for polygon
- [x] Add precompute function for shape to speed up rendering
- [ ] Add proper dielectric material
- [ ] SIMD? Research and implementation
- [ ] BVH
